At the time of a child being welcomed into a family, either at the news of pregnancy or by being welcomed at a later stage, the mother, father or both parents will choose an inexpensive ring and will keep it safe.

At the time of puberty, through menses, voice-changing or a time of the childâ€™s choosing, the child gets to choose how they want to be perceived in the world: they, she, he. This is fluid.

Family and friends can gather for a feast that celebrates the joys of childhood, the independence of adulthood and the wonderful in-between the child is living in. The child is presented with the ring that their parent/s chose at the point of welcoming.

Alternatively, if the child wishes, they could choose to skip this rite and will be presented with the ring without fanfare.
