Divination is personal, much like the concept of a soul.

Before beginning a divination rite, a period of gratefulness is encouraged. Bless yourself with water and give thanks for all the good that you have witnessed. 

If needed, write down your worries or fears and burn them in a fire-safe bowl. Bury the ashes under a tree.

Anything can be an oracle, if we declare it so. 

Do not hold a divination responsible for what happens, but rather, focus on what you can do with your emotions and actions.
