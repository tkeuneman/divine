Anyone can contribute to the base structure of the religion, a merge will occur once it has been approved to be free of bigotry by volunteer peers.

People are free to use the god/dess as a base for other religions and cultures, as long as contribution is maintained. 

It is possible to make commercial use out of open-source material, as long as contribution is maintained, helping to cut down on appropriation.

It is up to every person's personal choice on whether any tool they create falls under the GNU AGPLv3, but it is encouraged.
