God/dess is an art work that uses the framework of early religions and the methodology and tools of contemporary technology to create a religious space within a gallery that is free of bigotry, patriarchy and colonialism.

Through the process of deconstruction, the works build around the ideas of a religion; basic rites that mark a human life, rituals to bind us together and a localised god/dess that gives guidance when asked.

God/dess is open-source, which means that anyone can contribute, branch off and make suggestions during the exhibition or online. Using a common software process, the contribution is reviewed by peers to be free of bigotry and labels and is then merged. A history of every change is documented. 

It is my hope that by having this as a participatory work, it will be more well-rounded. 

This isocracy model encourages transparency and community.
