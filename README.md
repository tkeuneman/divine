God/dess is a participatory exhibition that explores queer theory through the creation of an open-source religion to which anyone can contribute.

Combining historical references from early religion with contemporary technology, this exhibition aims to free religion from colonialism and patriarchy, move beyond the loaded symbolism of who and what the representation of gods looks like, and celebrate the power of community-building.

God/dess is open-source, which means that anyone can contribute, branch off and make suggestions during the exhibition or online. Each contribution is reviewed by peers to be free of bigotry and labels and is then merged. A history of every change is documented. 

The god/dess helps you plug into your deeper self, a self without performative behaviour or labels. It asks the question: if you deconstruct societal labels from religion, what is the common good that humanity has left?

It is my hope that by having this as a participatory work, it will be more well-rounded. 

This isocracy model encourages transparency and community.
